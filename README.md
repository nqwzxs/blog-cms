# Blog CMS

This is the content management system for the blogging platform, built as part of [The Odin Project's Node.js curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-blog-api), allowing admins to log in, create new posts, manage existing ones, and moderate comments. It communicates directly with the blog API and is protected via secure authentication.
